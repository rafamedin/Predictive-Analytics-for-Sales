# Predictive Analytics for Sales Documentation

## Overview
Predictive Analytics for Sales is a complex Python project aimed at forecasting sales figures based on historical data. The project incorporates advanced techniques such as feature engineering, ensemble learning, hyperparameter tuning, and model interpretation to build a robust predictive model.

## Features
- Preprocessing of data including handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical features.
- Utilization of various regression models such as RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, XGBRegressor, and LGBMRegressor.
- Implementation of ensemble learning techniques including StackingRegressor with a meta-estimator.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
- Feature selection to identify the most important features for predicting sales.
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual sales values and feature importance.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/predictive-analytics-for-sales.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd predictive-analytics-for-sales
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your sales data in CSV format with columns including 'Date', 'Sales', 'Marketing Channel', 'Marketing Spend', 'Promotions', 'Competitor Price', and 'Weather'.
2. Modify the `sales_data.csv` file or replace it with your own dataset.
3. Run the main Python script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
4. The script will preprocess the data, train the predictive model, perform hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate the model's performance.
5. The results including Mean Squared Error, R-squared, and visualizations will be displayed in the console and saved in the project directory.

## Configuration
- Adjust hyperparameters and model configurations in the `main.py` script.
- Modify feature selection parameters and model interpretation techniques as needed.
- Customize visualization settings to suit your preferences.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- lightgbm
